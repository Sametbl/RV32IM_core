# RV32IM_core

This is a **RISC-V RV32IM processor core** currently under development by a student at **HCMUT**. The design is written in **SystemVerilog** and targets FPGA implementation. The core supports the **RV32IM** instruction set.

## Instruction Set Architecture
This processor implements the **RV32I base integer ISA**, with support extended to **RV32IM**. The RV32IM maintains the same architecture as RV32I but adds multiplication and division capabilities. You may find detailed ISA documentation below:

## RV32I Design Notes (Author's Guide)
If you're interested in how the **RV32I integer core was designed and implemented**, you can refer to this document written by the author.  
Since RV32IM is simply an extension of RV32I with the Multiply/Divide (`M`) instructions added, the architecture remains the same.
