# RV32IM_core

This is a custom **RISC-V RV32IM processor core** currently under development by a student at HCMUT. The project is implemented in **SystemVerilog** and supports the **RV32IM** instruction set.

## Instruction Set Architecture
The implementation is based on the official **RISC-V ISA specification**.  
Reference: [`riscv32i_instruction_set.pdf`](./riscv32i_instruction_set.pdf)
